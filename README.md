### **Step 1: Set Up Firebase**
1. Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Click on **Project Settings** â†’ **Add app** (choose Android).
3. Enter your **package name**, matching your Android project.
4. Download the **google-services.json** file and place it inside the `app/` folder.
5. Enable **Firestore Database** or **Realtime Database** from Firebase.
6. Configure Firebase authentication if required.

### **Step 2: Set Up Android Studio**
1. Open **Android Studio** and load the **Faculty App** project.
2. Add Firebase dependencies in your `build.gradle` file:
   ```gradle
   implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:21.0.1'
   implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:24.0.2'
   implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-storage:20.0.2'
   ```
3. Sync the project and make sure Firebase is correctly integrated.

### **Step 3: Connect Firebase to Your App**
1. Initialize Firebase in your `MainActivity.java` or other necessary files:
   ```java
   FirebaseAuth auth = FirebaseAuth.getInstance();
   FirebaseFirestore db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance();
   ```
2. Implement authentication, faculty data storage, and retrieval logic.
3. Use Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database for storing faculty details.

### **Step 4: Test and Run the Project**
1. Verify Firebase is correctly **sending** and **retrieving** faculty data.
2. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
3. Debug errors and ensure all functionalities work smoothly.

### **Step 5: Upload the Project to GitHub**
1. Create a new repository on **GitHub**.
2. Push the project using Git commands:
   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit for Faculty App"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### **Step 6: Create a README File in GitHub**
1. In your repository, click **Add file** â†’ **Create new file**.
2. Name the file `README.md` and include the following:

```
